=========================
Encyclopedist of the Natural World
----------------------------------

When Joseph Leidy started his career in 1845, scientific research was dominated by gentlemen amateurs and wealthy collectors. By the end of his life, science in the United States had become increasingly professionalized and specialized. Leidy straddled these two worlds. He was an acclaimed researcher, but his income came primarily from teaching and an assortment of administrative duties. Unlike the specialized scientists of the late 19th Century, however, he had expertise in and made significant contributions to a wide range of subjects. To borrow the apt subtitle of Leonard Warren's recent biography, Leidy was "the last man who knew everything."

Known as the "Father of American Vertebrate Paleontology", Leidy described the first relatively complete dinosaur skeleton, Hadrosaurus, and introduced many American and European scientists to the fossil riches of the American West. Leidy's consummate skill in comparative anatomy would allow him to identify and characterize even the most fragmentary fossil material.

Leidy was also the "Founder of American Parasitology," a Professor of Anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania, a pioneering protozoologist, an influential teacher of Natural History, an accomplished microscopist and scientific illustrator, and an expert on a variety of subjects encompassing the earth and natural sciences. He published scientific papers on more than a thousand extinct and living protozoa, fungi and invertebrates and vertebrates as well as an assortment of publications on human biology and medicine. He was also one of the earliest supporters of Charles Darwin.

Leidy was a passionate advocate of employing the microscope in scientific research. He was first introduced to the tool by his medical school mentor, Dr. Paul Goddard and he emphasized its usefulness to his own students. In his research Leidy used the microscope to examine a wide range of subjects, including fossils, gems, parasites, forensic medicine and human tissues. Notable among his microscopic studies are his 1848 study on the microstructure of the liver, his 1853 parasitology monograph ("Flora and Fauna within Living Animals"), his 1879 protozoology monograph ("Fresh-Water Rhizopods of North America") and his study of endosymbionts in termites ("The Parasites of the Termites").

![squid](http://web.archive.org/web/20110522092152im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/other/images/loligo.gif)

Leidy's use of the microscope also yielded findings that had public health implications. His examination of parasite cysts in cooked ham led him to advocate the thorough cooking of meat to prevent infection by harmful parasites. Examinations of microorganisms in housefly mouthparts led him to conclude that they were carriers of disease and led him to he advocate measures to reduce their presence in hospitals. Leidy's microscopic studies also allowed him to debunk a popular theory that various respiratory diseases (including asthma and hay fever) were caused by an infusorian, Asthmatos ciliaris. He reported that the suspected agent of disease was simply tissue debris from the mucus of patients.

Leidy's expertise in a wide range of subjects led many people to seek him for assistance. Doctors would approach him with difficult diagnoses, collectors would seek him when they had unusual specimens, and dealers and jeweler sought him to authenticate their gems.

One striking example of Leidy-as-expert occurred in 1862. Leidy was asked by the Philadelphia City Council to investigate an insect infestation in the city's parks. A month later he submitted his report, which contained detailed descriptions of the five species he found, their life histories and remedies for controlling them. Once the word spread, Leidy began to receive queries on insect pests from around the country.

As stated before, Leidy was a professional scientist whose income came primarily from teaching and administrative duties. His scientific research, however, is his lasting legacy. It was also a central pleasure of his life. In the concluding remarks of his 1879 monograph, Freshwater Rhizopods of North America Leidy wrote:

>"The study of natural history in the leisure of my life, since I was 14 years of age, has been to me a constant source of happiness; and my experience of it is such that independently of its higher merits, I warmly recommend it as a pastime, than which, I believe, no other can excel it".

Father of American Vertebrate Paleontology
===============================================

Joseph Leidy is best known for his study of the dinosaur Hadrosaurus foulkii, which greatly advanced knowledge of these prehistoric giants and placed the United States at the scientific forefront of vertebrate paleontology. Leidy studied other fossil animals, including fishes and reptiles, but most of Leidy's paleontological work was on prehistoric mammals, especially those from the American West.

![leidy foulkii](http://web.archive.org/web/20110512123304im_/http://www.ansp.org:80/museum/leidy/paleo/images/Leidy-1858-hadro-mini.jpg)

Leidy was the leading American expert on anatomy and vertebrate paleontology during the middle 19th Century. Because of this, fossil collectors from across the country sent their finds to his office at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Liedy was thankful for these offerings and would acknowledge the collectors in print. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art for the collection and care of fossils was so primitive that the specimens were usually badly damaged and seriously incomplete. Despite these limitations, Leidy's mastery of comparative anatomy and powers of observation enabled him to generate numerous major findings and discoveries.

Leidy wrote approximately 230 publications on paleontology. Many of these were short notes, but others were important contributions to science. Among these are his numerous descriptions of new species and his studies on fossil horses and extinct ground sloths. He also published four monographs: The Ancient Fauna of Nebraska (1853), Cretaceous Reptiles of the United States (1865), On the Extinct Mammalia of Dakota and Nebraska (1869), and Extinct Vertebrate Fauna of the Western Territories (1873). He described a total of 130 new genera and over 300 species of fossil vertebrates. (See Fossil Species for more on several of the more significant species studied by Leidy.)

The paleontological contributions of Joseph Leidy were highly regarded in both the United States and Europe. Leidy also helped the advancement of paleontology through the training and encouragement of others. Ironically, the reduction of Leidy's studies in paleontology was prompted by the actions of one of his proteges, Edward Drinker Cope, and one of his admirers, Orthniel C. Marsh. The bitter competition between these two rivals, known as the Bone Wars, disgusted Leidy and dried-up his sources for fossils from the American West. Although the quantity and quality of the fossils available to Cope and Marsh typically exceeded Leidy's, it is the quality of Leidy's work that has generally stood the test of time.

Human Anatomy

![lecture](http://web.archive.org/web/20110414003327im_/http://www.ansp.org:80/museum/leidy/other/images/medical.jpg)

Joseph Leidy's special talents in human anatomy were evident while he was a medical student at the University of Pennsylvania. His main teacher and mentor, Dr. Paul Goddard, enlisted Leidy to become his assistant. A year following his graduation, he was made prosector to Dr. William Horner, who was the Professor of Anatomy and Dean of the Medical School.

Despite considerable opposition, Leidy was appointed Professor of Anatomy following Dr. Horner's death in 1853. At only 31 years of age, Leidy held the most prestigious position at the most important medical school in the country. He kept this job for the next 38 years. This position provided Leidy with a steady income base which enabled him to pursue his true avocation, scientific research.

The scope of Leidy's knowledge and interests were on full display during his first introductory lecture on anatomy. He exposed his students to many revolutionary ideas. First, he emphasized that the study of human anatomy was only a branch of comparative anatomy. He also discussed many of the pressing problems of 19th century biology, including the cellular basis of life, spontaneous generation, and the role of anatomy, physiology, chemistry and the microscope in understanding disease.

One of the challenges facing the new Professor of Anatomy was the lack of a good textbook on human anatomy. In response, he wrote An Elementary Treatise on Human Anatomy in 1861. This book helped modernize medical education and remained a standard medical textbook for several generations.

*Notes:*

+ Dr. Paul Goddard (1811-1866) made significant contributions to medicine and medical education. He was also an important pioneer in early photography, developing a crucial improvement in the daguerreotype process. He was an important influence early in Leidy's career. He introduced Leidy to the microscope which proved crucial in much of Leidy's later research. He also helped launch Leidy's scientific career by recommending the young Leidy to Amos Binney, a zoologist in Boston who needed an anatomist and scientific illustrator.
+ The Prosector conducts the dissection for the professor.
+ Dr. William Horner: Horner (1793-1853) made significant contributions to surgery, pathology and the anatomy of the eye. As dean of the Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania, Horner oversaw the school's resurgence following its decline in the early 1800s.
+ Leidy was regarded by many as the best choice to succeed Horner, but some influential people objected to his young age, lack of social standing within the upper class, and his questionable religious beliefs.
+ Comparative Anatomy is the study of similarities and differences of anatomy among species. This science originated in Europe, and was introduced into the United States during the 19th Century by a number of scientists and educators, including Leidy. By saying that human anatomy was a part of comparative anatomy, Leidy challenged the notion that human biology was unique and distinct from that of animals.
+ Two Europeans, Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, proposed in 1838 that cells were the fundamental units of all living plants and animals. This discovery was made possible by the microscope and it stimulated the use of this tool for further research. It also led to the idea that cells (and all living things) come from cells and not from spontaneous generation.
+ For centuries, people thought that many living things arose spontaneously. After all, how else could one explain the sudden appearance of mold on bread or of tiny animals in a new pool of water? This idea, Spontaneous Generation, was popular in science and medicine during the first half of the 19th Century, but it was finally discredited through the efforts of Leidy and others.
+ Most American doctors and many medical educators of the early 19th Century believed that their job was to treat patients with time-honored methods. They saw little value in medical research. Some even denounced the microscope as a useless gadget that confounded our understanding of nature. Leidy was an advocate for medical research and for the microscope as a research tool. He believed that it was a vital tool for the understanding of both life and disease. In the end, the microscope proved crucial to discrediting the idea of spontaneous generation and laid the groundwork for the revolutionary idea that many diseases are caused by microscopic organisms such as bacteria and viruses.

## Leidy Lectures

![upenn](http://web.archive.org/web/20110318161215im_/http://www.ansp.org:80/museum/leidy/other/images/Leidy_class-a.jpg)

This 1888 photograph shows Joseph Leidy (standing next to the table on the right) lecturing on anatomy to medical students at the University of Pennsylvania. One impression you can get from this photograph is that 19th Century medicine was the domain of white males. Women and minority men were excluded from most university medical schools during the 19th Century.

In 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell became one of the first women to graduate from an American medical school, but she and other women had to endure considerable opposition. The opportunity for women to enter medicine improved with the establishment of the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1850. This Philadelphia school became the first approved and legal medical school for women in the world. Soon other medical schools for women were established in other cities, including Boston, New York, Baltimore and Cleveland. The success of their graduates helped promote the acceptance of female physicians in the second half of the 19th Century, but university medical schools were slow to open their doors to women until the end of the century.

Leidy's views on women in medical schools is not known, but we do know that he was sympathetic to their participation in Natural History and Biology. Leidy welcomed women to his public lectures on Natural History at the University of Pennsylvania despite vocal objections from some men in the audience. There are at least two later episodes in which Leidy evidently facilitated the scientific education of individual women. Finally, as director of the newly created Department of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania Leidy welcomed the entering class of ten men and two women.

*Notes:*

+ The Female Medical College of Pennsylvania was later renamed the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania. It is now the Drexel University College of Medicine.
+ In 1878, Grace Anna Lewis requested that she be allowed to attend Leidy's course in comparative anatomy which was not normally open to women. Subsequent correspondences between the two indicate that she did take the course. In 1884, Adele M. Fielde approached Leidy and the Academy of Natural Science for assistance in her research interests. She was provided with facilities and guidance and later published on a wide variety of Natural History topics.

## Treatise on Human Anatomy (1861)

Joseph Leidy published An Elementary Treatise on Human Anatomy in 1861 following years of frustration with the lack of a clear and usable textbook on human anatomy. His book was widely acclaimed by critics and adopted by American medical students and physicians for several generations. This book helped establish Leidy as the foremost American anatomist of the age.

The book was 663 pages long and contained a total of 397 illustrations. (Many of the illustrations were drawn by Leidy himself.) Leidy created a book that could be used as a dissection manual as well as a textbook. Students could take it into the lab to guide them as they examined cadavers.

![anatomy](http://web.archive.org/web/20110318160040im_/http://www.ansp.org:80/museum/leidy/other/images/Fig_250%20_neck.jpg)

This book wasn't a radical departure from earlier textbooks. Instead, it contained updated information and a number of improvements. Perhaps the most significant improvement was its clarity. One of the most serious shortcomings of earlier textbooks was the confusing jumble of technical names. Leidy responded by using English names whenever possible and writing concise and clear text. He is reported to have tested its clarity by reading the manuscript aloud while a colleague identified the corresponding parts and tissues while examining a cadaver.

Leidy discussed the fundamental qualities of living matter in the introduction to his book. He stated that all living bodies were the products of their parents and that he knew of no evidence that had ever demonstrated spontaneous generation. He goes on to say that living matter derives its substance from the mineral world. As such, he argues, it's subject to the same physical laws. He then discusses the chemical composition of the body and the different types of tissues. As with many of his other writings, Leidy advocated the microscope and a vital tool.

The introduction continues with Leidy's endorsement of Darwin's theory of Natural Selection. He emphaizes that life has existed for "incalculable ages" and that "this process of the successive origin and extinction of races or series of species has continued without interrruption down to the present period."

A completely revised and expanded second edition of An Elementary Treatise on Human Anatomy was completed in 1889, two years before Leidy's death. The discussions on the nature of living matter, spontantous generation and evolution were not included in this edition, presumably because these ideas were already widely adopted by his readers.

-----------------------------------

Leidy and Darwin
================

Joseph Leidy, the master describer of nature, and Charles Darwin, Biology's greatest theoretician, met only once. The two were introduced to each other by Richard Owen during Leidy's first visit to Europe in 1848. Both Leidy and Darwin were young at the time. Leidy was relatively unknown at the time, while Darwin was best known for his travel narrative The Voyage of the Beagle.

In the decades before Darwin published his On the Origin of Species scientists had struggled with a growing body of information at odds with scriptures. Geologists presented compelling evidence that the world was extremely old. Paleontologists revealed past worlds populated by bizarre creatures that no longer existed. Biologists were confronted by similarities between species that begged for answers and variation within species that made no sense.

Leidy was well versed in the emerging conundrum. For instance, in a lecture given to his anatomy students in 1859 just months before the debut of The Origin of Species he said:

>"The geologist has satisfactorily proved that man and his contemporaries, animals and plants at least in their present form, have existed for a comparatively brief time. They further show that the race of animals and plants of our day were proceeded by a different race which became extinct. But more than this, they have discovered indisputable evidence that many races have existed and become extinct in succession. How the are we to account for this most wonderful appearance and disappearance of organized bodies? Have the latter races been the antecedents of those which preceded them by gradual transformation under a change of conditions in progress for ages or has each been the witness of the independent origin of a race of plants and animals? We can now form no opinion on the matter, though we may dimly see that we are accumulating facts from which our successors may perhaps derive positive opinions in the earliest history of organized beings."

Leidy was one of the first Americans to embrace Darwin's theory of Natural Selection. Upon reading On the Origin of Species, Leidy wrote Darwin a letter praising the book for putting light into day:

>"I feel as though I had hitherto groped about in darkness and that all of a sudden a meteor flashed upon the skies."

Darwin replied:

>"Your note has pleased me more than you could readily believe; for I have during a long time heard all good judges speak of your palaeontological labours in terms of the highest respect. Most paleontologists (with few good exceptions) entirely despise my work; consequently approbation from you has gratified me much. All the older geologists (with the exception of Lyell whom I look at as a host in himself) are even more vehement against the modification of species that are even the palaeontologists."

Leidy soon lobbied for the election of Darwin as a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. He succeeded in March 27, 1860. The Academy became the first American scientific institution to recognize Darwin's contributions.

Despite the scientific affinity of these two men, there's no subsequent record of either of them mentioning the other. Nor is there any evidence that they continued their correspondences. We do, however, know that Darwin read Leidy's later monographs.

Leidy embraced Darwin's theory of Natural Selection, but he did not mobilize his research efforts to support it. It's unclear whether this was the result of Leidy's reluctance to theorize, his aversion to intense public debates, or his firm belief that he best served science by collecting facts. In any case, Leidy continued to believe that life including humans evolved from earlier forms.

*Notes:*

+ Richard Owen was the dean of British comparative anatomy and vertebrate paleontology. Although he was a mentor for the young Charles Darwin, he became a staunch critic of evolution in general and of Darwin's theory of Natural Selection in particular.
+ Many people think that Darwin invented the theory of evolution, which essentially is that species evolve (or change over time) into new species. But in fact, evolutionary change was becoming accepted by a growing number of scientists, including Leidy. Nonetheless, Darwin's contributions were essential to the scientific acceptance of Evolution during the 19th Century and central to our current understanding of evolutionary biology.
+ Darwin mustered an immense and compelling body of evidence to demonstrate that evolution happens and that it was the result of "decent with modification". In other words, the living things of the present are modified (or evolved) versions of their ancestors.
+ The majority of Darwin's peers embraced his arguments for evolution and decent with modification, but most of them were either reluctant or hostile to his contentions that evolution was gradual and that it was primarily caused by Natural Selection. Alternative mechanisms for evolution would proliferate during the second half of the 19th Century and into the next, including Neo-Lamarkism (inheritance of acquired characteristics), Orthogenesis (innately deterministic and directed evolution), and Saltation (dramatic and disjunct evolutionary change within lineages).
+ Darwin's theory of Natural Selection states that there is variation within populations (and species). Because of this variability, some individuals within the population are better suited for their environment than others. Those that are better suited (or better adapted) will be more successful at reproduction than those that are not. Consequently, the offspring of the better-suited individuals will account for an increased proportion of the next generation. Over multiple generations, the decedents of the better-suited individuals will become the majority of the population and change the nature of that population. In other words, the population evolved.
+ Darwin didn't understand why populations were variable. But his extensive research and experience demonstrated this to be so. He also didn't understand how offspring inherit characteristics from their parents, but it was clear that they did inherit characteristics from their parents. The mechanisms for variability and inheritance would have to wait several decades for the development of the science of genetics. Even then, many scientists dismissed Natural Selection as an important contributor to evolution. It wasn't until the Evolutionary Synthesis in third and fourth decades of the 20th century that Genetics and Natural Selection were reconciled.

-----------------------------------

Founder of American Parasitology
=================================

Joseph Leidy's contribution to American Parasitology is perhaps second only to his contribution to Vertebrate Paleontology. Although several European scientists were active during the 19th Century, Leidy was essentially the only American researcher in the field. His work was highly regarded in Europe, but it wasn't until the early part of the 20th Century that it was broadly appreciated by his American peers.

Leidy's parasitological studies were concentrated into two separate periods. The first period (1846-1858) began early in Leidy's scientific career, while the second (1874-1891) occupied the latter part. In between, Leidy's research efforts were concentrated on Vertebrate Paleontology.

Early studies included many short articles and notices covering parasites from a wide variety of animals. Notable among these are his discoveries of canine heartworm and of the human parasite Trichina spiralis in pork. This period is also notable for two larger works. In 1853 Leidy published a groundbreaking monograph titled A Flora and Fauna Within Living Animals. In 1856 he published a synopsis (summary) of his studies on parasites. This synopsis contains brief descriptions and host information of a total of 172 species of parasitic protozoans, flukes, tapeworms and nematodes.

![fluke](http://web.archive.org/web/20110929160436im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/other/images/Distoma_horridus.jpg)
![nemotode](http://web.archive.org/web/20110929160436im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/other/images/filaria.gif)

In 1874, after nearly 16 years during which his efforts were devoted to paleontology, Leidy resumed his studies in parasitology. In addition to numerous shorter publications, he published longer articles on the tapeworms in birds, parasites of shad and herring, leeches and the symbionts of termites. He also revised a section on medical parasitology ("Parasites and the Diseases They Produce") for an American edition of the British medical publication, System of Surgery, and wrote a treatise on human intestinal parasites in Dr. William Pepper's A System of Practical Medicine. His work in Pepper's publication represents the first comprehensive presentation of human parasites ever published in America.

Leidy's mastery of comparative anatomy and microscopic observation were manifest in his study of parasites. He reported on microscopic features undetected by leading European scientists. He also differed with his European peers in the classification of many of the minute animals he discovered. The Europeans commonly shoehorned new organisms into "time honored and universally accepted" genera (groups of related species). Leidy was also generally inclined to assign new species to existing groups, but he often found new species that that were significantly different. So he found himself erecting many new genera. His European peers sometimes rejected his findings, but Leidy characteristically avoided the challenge and concluded that time will tell who was right. In most cases, Leidy's work was ultimately confirmed by later researchers (both European and American).

His European colleagues (and millions of other people) should have also heeded Leidy's recommendations for the prevention of parasitic diseases by thoroughly cooking meat. As early as 1853 he wrote:

> "Cooking food is of advantage in destroying the germs of parasites, hence man, notwithstanding his liability to the latter, is less infested than most other mammalia."

*Notes:*

+ Parasitology is the study of parasites. A parasite is now defined as an organism living in or on another organism (the host) from which it obtains food. A parasite is harmful (but not necessarily fatal) to its host.
+ Not all of the "parasites" studied by Leidy and other 19th Century parasitologists meet this modern definition of parasites. Instead, they used the term "parasite" to mean one organism that lived on or in another. They also used the term "entozoan" (= inside animal) to refer to an animal that lived inside another and endophyte (=inside plant) for algae, fungi or bacteria that lived inside an animal.
+ Modern scientists use the term symbiosis (=living with) for the intimate association of different organisms. (Symbionts are the organisms that partake in the association.) Three broad categories of symbiosis are recognized: Commensalism is a symbiosis in which neither organism is harmed or helped. Mutalism is a symbiosis in which both are helped (an often where both are dependent upon each other). Parasitism is a symbiosis in which one symbiont (the parasite) is harmful to the other (its host).
+ The lack of appreciation by American parasitologists was largely a consequence of Leidy's lone status in the field. He was essentially the only American working in the field until the turn of the century. Another factor was the change in scientific methods. Leidy was primarily a describer of nature. The next generation of parasitologists depended heavily on experimental methods. By the 1920's however, they began to realize the breadth and scope of his contributions.
+ Canine heartworm is a common parasitic disease of dogs caused by the nematode Dirofilaria immitis. The parasites lives in the heart and large blood vessels of the lungs and cause heart and lung failure in the hosts. Leidy discovered and described this parasite in 1856.
+ Trichinia spiralis is a parasite of humans and the cause of trichinosis. The disease had been a major public health problem for many years in both Europe and North America. The adult worms were first described by British scientists in 1835, but no one knew how the parasite infected humans. Leidy first reported on finding the parasite in pork in the October 1846 issue of the Proceedings of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. One year later, this report was reprinted in a British journal, the Annals and Magazine of Natural History. The world's leading expert in parasitic worms, Karl Moritz Deising, incorporated Leidy's findings in his classic and influential monograph "Systema Helminthum" in 1851. Unfortunately, Deising referred to Leidy's parasite as Trichinia affinis (a parasite that does not infect humans) rather than Trichinia spiralis. Consequently, European scientists investigating the life history of Trichina sprialis were unaware of (or dismissed) Leidy's discovery. Leidy again reported on the relationship between the parasite and pork in 1853 and 1866; both times he stated that thorough cooking killed the parasite and prevented infection. These later reports were apparently unknown or ignored by the Europeans. It would take nearly two decades following Leidy's first report to learn of the connection between the parasite and pork.

+ Protozoans are unicellular (or acelluar) organisms that were once classified as animals. Their current classification is a matter of debate, but most biologists recognize that they represent several, widely divergent evolutionary lineages. Most protozoans are not parasitic, but some parasitic forms are responsible for some of our most serious diseases. Giardiasis (Giardia), sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma) and malaria (Plasmodium) are three examples of protozoan parasitic diseases. Flukes (trematodes) and tapeworms (cestodes) are two groups of exclusively parasitic flatworms (Platyhelminthes) that are distantly related to the common flatworm, Planaria. Nematodes (roundworms) comprise a diverse and extremely abundant group of worm-like animals found in virtually all habitats. Most are free-living, but many are parasites of plants or animals (including humans).
+ Leeches (Hirudinea) comprise a group of segmented worms related to earthworms. Most live in freshwater and prey on small invertebrates, but some are bloodsucking parasites of vertebrates.
+ A former student of Leidy, William Pepper was the driving force in modernizing medical education at the University of Pennsylvania in the second half of the 19th Century. He was also instrumental in diversifying the university through the creation of the Schools of Dentistry, Biology and Veterinary Medicine.
+ Perhaps the most notable case where Leidy outdid his European peers involved gregorines. Leidy detected minute fribrillae (hair-like structures) that he concluded to be the first traces of muscular structures. This structure had been missed by Carl T. von Siebold, a leading European parasitologist. (Gregorines are microscopic parasites which belong to either the Sporozoa or the Apicomplexa. The most infamous apicomplexan is Plasmodium, the parasite that causes malaria.)
+ Leidy named at least 806 new genera of animals, fungi and protozoans. The largest share were vertebrates, but he named at least 113 protozoans and 339 invertebrates, many of which were parasites.

Professor of Natural History
=============================

Joseph Leidy conducted research at The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and served as a Professor of Anatomy at the medical school of the University of Pennsylvania. He also taught Natural History at these and other institutions in and near Philadelphia.

His first major job teaching Natural History was at the same university where he taught human anatomy. In response to declining enrollment, the University of Pennsylvania enlisted Leidy in 1862 to give a series of lectures on Natural History and physiology. The lectures would be directed at medical students, but for the first time the public was invited for a fee. The lectures on Natural History proved so successful that Leidy continued giving them until 1867.

Leidy's second major opportunity to teach the subject was at Swarthmore College, a new Quaker liberal arts college west of Philadelphia. Several supporters and administrators of the new school were friends of Leidy. They prevailed upon him to accept the position of Professor of Natural History in February 1871. Leidy's duties at Swarthmore included lecturing on Natural History, establishing and curating a Natural History museum, and the creation of a library. His lectures were very popular and his natural history course was a major attraction for the new college. Leidy was soon asked to teach a second course on Mineralogy and Geology. Leidy taught at Swarthmore until 1885, when the demands of his position at the University of Pennsylvania forced him to curtail his activities at Swarthmore, but he retained his title of Emeritus Professor until his death in 1891.

In 1884, the University of Pennsylvania founded the Department of Biology and appointed Leidy as the department's director and as a Professor of Comparative Anatomy and Zoology. Leidy also played important roles in the creation of the university's School of Veterinary Medicine, School of Dentistry and Archaeological Association. The last association would eventually give rise to the University Museum of Archaeology.

In 1885, Leidy became faculty president and lead curator at another Philadelphia institution, the Wagner Free Institute of Science. Leidy helped formulate a master plan for the institute, organized lecture series and the teaching curriculum, developed the library, expanded the collections and started a new professional publication, the Transactions of the Wagner Free Institute of Science. Leidy also reorganized the institute's public museum.

Leidy spent virtually his entire career in intimate association with the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Yet he was at best a reluctant contributor to the institution's public education programs. Part of his reluctance was due to his shy nature, but he was perfectly willing to lecture to college students. Leidy was skeptical of the general public, which he regarded as uneducated and superstitious. This attitude changed somewhat with his appointment at the Wagner Free Institute, but he clearly preferred the insular world of academia.

In one respect, however, Leidy fully participated in the educational mission of the Academy. He made the Academy collections, facilities and himself available to students from the University of Pennsylvania and elsewhere.

Whether he lectured on or informally discussed natural history, Leidy impressed his listeners with his encyclopedic knowledge. A legend at Swarthmore College was that he was never stumped despite repeated attempts by students presenting exotic specimens. Yet he was a humble and gracious speaker. W.S.W. Ruschenberger, a longtime friend from the Academy recalled Leidy's typical introduction to his audience:

> "My name is Joseph Leidy, Doctor of Medicine. I was born in this city on 9th of September, 1823, and I have lived here ever since. ... At an early age I took great delight in natural history an in noticing all natural objects. I have reason to think that I know a little of natural history, and a little of that little I propose to teach you to-night."

*Notes:*

+ The Wagner Free Institute of Science was opened in 1865 with the mission of providing free public education in natural history and other sciences. The institute is appropriately described as a "museum of a museum." The public museum and lecture hall appear today largely as they did during Leidy's tenure.

Freshwater Rhizopods of North America
===========================================

Fresh-Water Rhizopods of North America was Joseph Leidy's last monograph. (He continued to write shorter publications primarily on parasites during the remaining years of his life.) It contained 324 pages and 48 lithographic plates.

Rhizopods are a group of single-celled (or acellular) organisms that are traditionally classified as protozoans. These microscopic organisms had been studied by European scientists since the time of Leeuwenhoek, but this book effectively marks the beginning of Protozoology in the United States.

Leidy limited his monograph to free-living, non-parasitic freshwater forms. Most of his rhizopods were collected from marshes, ponds and streams near Philadelphia, but others were collected from elsewhere in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as well as from Connecticut, Rhode Island, the Bridger Basin (southwestern Wyoming) and in the vicinity of the Bay of Fundy in Canada.

The introduction to Fresh-Water Rhizopods of North America contains an overview of the group, which Leidy (and his scientific peers) regarded as the "simplest of all animals." He also takes the opportunity in the introduction to promote the use of the microscope as a research tool:

> "The revelations of the microscope are perhaps not exceeded in importance by those of the telescope. While exciting our curiosity, our wonder and admiration, they have proved of infinite service in advancing our knowledge of things around us. The present work, founded on such revelations, I have attempted to prepare in a matter to render it easy of comprehension, with the view of promoting and encouraging a taste for microscopic investigations."

![rhizopods](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017202811im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/other/images/rhizopod-composite_510.jpg)

Leidy expressed considerable frustration with the illustrations that graced his book. He did the original drawings (later copied to make the lithographic plates), but he regarded them as inadequate for representing the miniature marvels he saw in the microscope. He was captivated by their complex movements, variable colors, and ever-changing shapes.

Although Leidy was unsatisfied, the illustrations were cherished by others. Some of the drawings were preserved in bound volumes by Leidy's colleague and friend Joseph Willcox. Herbert S. Jennings, a leading American zoologist of the early 20th century, regarded Leidy as a scientific artist. He also regarded Fresh-water Rhizopods of North America as a "masterpiece" and " a section of nature permanently presented to us."

+ Protozoans (= first animals) is a group of single-celled organisms that have traditionally been regarded as animals. They are usually classified into four sub-groups: Flagellata (flagellates such as Euglena), Sarcodina (rhizopods such as Amoeba), Ciliophora (cilliates such as Paramecium), and Sporozoa (includes the malaria parasite Plasmodium). Their classification has been difficult because the group is extremely diverse. Scientists have long suspected that protozoans represent several very different evolutionary lineages. Recent studies have confirmed their multiple origins, but a satisfactory classification scheme is still being developed.
+ Antoni von Leeuwenhoek, the inventor of the microscope, first reported on protozoans in the 1670s, but the science of remained undeveloped until the 19th century.

Biography
==========

Joseph Leidy (1823-1891) was one of the leading American scientists of the 19th century. He was the Father of American Vertebrate Paleontology, the Founder of American Parasitology, a leading teacher in human anatomy and Natural History and an expert in a wide range of life and earth sciences. Although he traveled to Europe and the American West, he spent virtually all of his life in Philadelphia.

![timeline](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017202839im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/other/images/timeline.gif)

1823

Joseph Leidy is born on September 9. His mother was Catherine (Mellick) Leidy and his father was Philip Leidy, a respectable but undistinguished hat maker. They lived in Philadelphia.

1825

Joseph Leidy's mother dies while giving birth to his brother Thomas. Joseph was less than two years old at the time.

1826

Philip Leidy marries Christiana Mellick (Catherine's first cousin). As an adult, Joseph Leidy would comment that his stepmother was "the mother I have known, who was all in all to me, the one to whom I owe all that I am."

Childhood

As a child, Joseph Leidy, showed little enthusiasm for school and the recreational activities undertaken by most boys, but he had a distinct talent for drawing and an strong interest in Natural History. He spent much of his spare time exploring vacant lots, woodlands, open fields, and the banks of the Schuylkill River. Later, these romps would take Leidy farther afield, including one trip to Maine in the company of the artist Richard Kern. An avid collector, his first interests were in minerals and plants, but this soon expanded to include animals and archaeology.

When he was 16, Leidy would spend a few hours each day working in his cousin's apothecary. There he learned about medicinal plants and their preparation. He was offered, but declined, a job as the head of the botanical department of a pharmaceutical house.

1840

Joseph Leidy's practical father wanted Leidy to use his artistic abilities as a sign painter, but his stepmother believed Joseph's abilities to observe and record would be better served if he studied medicine and became a doctor.

Leidy began his medical education with a year of private study in anatomy with Dr. James McClintock. He finished his studies at the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, where his formal studies were conducted under the supervision of Dr. Paul Goddard.

A close relationship developed between Leidy and Goddard. Goddard recognized Leidy's gifts, made Leidy his assistant and encouraged Leidy's research interests. Goddard would introduce Leidy to the microscope, then an rare instrument in the United States. Goddard would also introduce Leidy to Amos Binney of Boston, a move that would launch Leidy's scientific career.

1844

Leidy receives his MD from the University of Pennsylvania. His thesis, "The Comparative Anatomy of the Eye in Vertebrated Animals" reveals his preference for research over the practice of medicine. He continued his affiliation with the university, serving as an assistant in the chemical lab and assisting his former professor, Dr. Goddard, in the anatomy department. A year later, Leidy would assist the university's dean and Professor of Anatomy, anatomist, Dr. William Horter. He would totally abandon his medical practice in 1847.

1845

Leidy's scientific career was launched when he was asked to provide dissection illustrations for Amos Binney, an eminent 1851 (four years after Binney's death). Binney was deeply impressed by Leidy's skills as an illustrator and researcher. Soon, Leidy was invited to submit several papers on snails to the Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History. He became a member in early July.

By late July, Leidy was invited to become a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. (The life membership fee was apparently paid for by Amos Binney.) At the age of twenty-two, Leidy was now a member of the two most prestigious scientific societies of the United States.

This was also the year of Leidy's first publications on Paleontology. One was a report on fossil clams from New Jersey, while another was the microscopic examination of an Eocene whale vertebra from Alabama.

1846

Leidy finds the cysts of Trichina spiralis (the human parasite responsible for trichinosis) in his breakfast ham. He also determines that cooking effectively kills the parasite. Unfortunately the reports of his findings are either ignored or remain unknown to the European scientists who are seeking this critical link in the parasite's life history.

This is also the year that Leidy is elected Chairman of the Board of Curators at The Academy of Natural Sciences. He will retain this position for the rest of his life. This election was partly the result of Leidy's success at the institution's librarian. The election also reflected tensions between gentlemen amateur naturalists and a rising groups of professional scientists. The struggle between these two camps would continue through much of the century.

1847

Leidy describes Poebrotherium wilsoni, an early camel from the White River Badlands of South Dakota. This is the first fossil animal to come to Leidy from the American West. He will receive fossils from this and other western localities for the next 25 years.

1848

Leidy publishes "On the Fossil Horses of America", which lays to rest any serious questions about the existence of horses before their reintroduction by the Spanish.

This is also the year of Leidy's first trip to Europe. He accompanies Dr. William Horter with the expressed purpose of obtaining teaching material for the medical school, but Leidy also visits the leading scientific institutions and meets with many of the leading scientists of Europe. He also has the opportunity to view the latest methods in microscopy and museum curatorship.

1849

Leidy begins work on the microscopic parasites of invertebrates. This work will result some years later in the publication of Flora and Fauna within Living Animals.

1850

This is also the year of Leidy's second trip to Europe. This time Leidy accompanies Dr. George Bacon Wood, a professor of the theory and practice of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. They obtain more medical teaching aids, but also go to leading scientific institutions and meet with leading scientists.
Leidy begins to concentrate on paleontology as more fossils from the White River Badlands of South Dakota become available.

1853

This was a particularly significant year for Joseph Leidy. He is appointed as the Professor of Anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania. This appointment provided Leidy with a steady income and allowed him to devote more time to scientific research.

Leidy also publishes two monographs: Flora and Fauna within Living Animals established Leidy as a leading authority on parasitology, while The Ancient Fauna of Nebraska summarized Leidy's work on the White River Badlands' fossils and served as an introduction to the scientific world of the paleontological treasures from the American West.

1855

Leidy publishes "A Memoir on the Extinct Sloth Tribe of North America", which summarizes the state of knowledge of the North American species of ground sloths.

1856

Leidy describes fossil teeth collected from the Judith River in Montana. Some of the teeth belong to the first American dinosaurs. Illustrations and more detailed description are published in 1860.

Leidy also publishes "A Synopsis of Entozoa and Some of their Ectocongeners", which lists 172 species of parasites he has studied up until that time.

1858

Leidy names and describes Hadrosaurus foulkii, the most complete dinosaur known skeleton of the mid-19th Century. Leidy's analysis demonstrated that the animal was bipedal, which directly counters the prevailing view of dinosaurs as established by Richard Owen, the world's leading authority.

1860

Leidy completes work on Cretaceous Reptiles of the United States, but publication is delayed by the onset of the Civil War.

1861

Leidy publishes "An Elementary Treatise on Human Anatomy" in response to his medical students' need for an anatomy textbook. The book establishes Leidy as the foremost anatomist in the United States.

1861 is also the first year of the Civil War. Leidy's natural history research came to a halt. His three younger brothers serve in the Union Army. One of them, Asher Leidy, becomes seriously wounded and discharged in 1863.

1862

Leidy's first Civil War duty begins in June 1962 when he serves as a pathologist at the Satterlee Military Hospital in Philadelphia. From this experience he contributed a series of reports on gastrointestinal disorders in a major government publication, "The Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion." In September, Leidy is appointed as chief surgeon for the City of Philadelphia and is charged with the responsibility of determining the fitness of draftees. He is also appointed as an inspector of the US Sanitary Commission.

Leidy also conducts a series of lectures on natural history at the University of Pennsylvania. Unlike his other lectures, these are open to the public. The program is so popular that they are continued until 1867.

1863

Leidy becomes a founding member of the National Academy of Sciences. This society was immediately embroiled in controversy because of its exclusionary politics. Leidy joined the reform efforts which ultimately succeeded in opening up the organization but the experience must have reinforced his his general dislike for professional societies.

1864

Joseph Leidy marries Anna Hardin in August, 1864. Relatively little is known about her, but accounts by friends and associates indicate the marriage was a happy one. Anna Leidy apparently had a serious interest in natural history. Joseph publicly credited her on several occasions for her assistance with his work. Moreover, Anna Leidy also joined the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).

1865

Cretaceous Reptiles of the United States is published following the end of the Civil War.

1869

Leidy publishes On the Extinct Mammalia of Dakota and Nebraska. This monograph is Leidy's definitive work on the White River Badlands fossils of South Dakota. It also covers fossils from the Niobrara River Valley of Nebraska, including a diversity of Miocene horses.

1870

Leidy begins to receive Eocene fossils from the Bridger Tertiary Formation of southwestern Wyoming.

1871

Leidy is appointed Professor of Natural History at Swarthmore College. He teaches at Swarthmore until 1885 and retains emeritus status thereafter.

1872

Joseph and Anna Leidy travel to Fort Bridger, Wyoming Territory. They visit Dr. Joseph K. Corson, a family friend and native Philidelphian. They will return again in 1873 and 1878. These trips are primarily family vacations, but some prospecting for fossils was done in the first two visits. Leidy collected rhizopods (microscopic protozoans) during the third visit.

1873

Contributions to the Extinct Vertebrate Fauna of the Western Territories is published. Much of this monograph is devoted to the Eocene Bridger fossils of Wyoming. The "Bone Wars" between O.C. Marsh and E. D. Cope escalates and Leidy significantly reduces his output in Vertebrate Paleontology.

1875

Leidy takes his third trip to Europe, but this is is first with his wife, Anna. He obtains museum specimens and teaching aids for Swarthmore College and the University of Pennsylvania.

1876

Anna and Joseph Leidy, who were childless, adopt a recently orphaned seven-year-old girl named Allwina. After some initial difficulties, Allwina thrives in the Leidy household.
Leidy is appointed director of the Zoological Society of Philadelphia and helps to establish the Philadelphia Zoo.

1879

Leidy publishes Fresh-Water Rhizopods of North America, the first significant publication on protozoology in the United States.

Leidy is also awarded the Medal of the Royal Microscopical Society from the distinguished British scientific society. This is the first of many prestigious awards from European and American scientific societies. Others include the Walker Prize from the Boston Society of Natural History (1880), the Lyell medal of the Geological Society of London (1884), an honorary degree from Harvard University (1886), and the Cuvier Medal from the Academy of Sciences of Paris (1888).

1881

Leidy publishes "Parasites of the Termites", a study of endosymbionts in the intestines of a termite.

1884

The University of Pennsylvania creates the Department of Biology and appoints Leidy as its director and as a Professor of Comparative Anatomy and Zoology.

1885

Leidy is appointed faculty president and head curator of the Wagner Free Institute of Science.

Leidy also writes a chapter on human intestinal parasites in William Pepper's A System of Practical Medicine. This represents the first comprehensive publication of human parasites in the United States.

1889

Joseph Leidy takes his last trip to Europe in order to obtain specimens for the Wagner Free Institute of Science and the University of Pennsylvania. He is accompanied by his wife Anna and their daughter Allwina. The trip is marred when Anna Leidy becomes seriously ill from what is probably typhoid fever.

1891

Declining health and a demanding workload take their toll on Leidy. After several days of being bedridden, he dies on April 30, apparently from a combination of strokes and arterial disease. He was 67 years old.
