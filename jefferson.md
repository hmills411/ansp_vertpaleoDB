==================================

If you were a guest at Thomas Jefferson's home at Monticello, you could see things that revealed the intellectual range of this remarkable Founding Father. The house, designed by Jefferson himself, was perhaps the most beautiful building in the new republic and inside it was the nation's greatest library. Throughout the building's public spaces you would see images and statues of major politicians and philosophers. And in the entry hall more a museum than anything else you could examine a variety of natural history and ethnographic specimens, including some from the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Among these displays were fossils of an impressive giant, the American mastodon.

Jefferson is rightfully renowned as the principal author of the Declaration of Independence, the Third President of the United States, and a champion of Liberty. But he was also a central player in the beginnings of American paleontology. In addition, his participation occurred at a time when people were struggling with the ideas of fossils as evidence of past life, of extinction, and of an Earth far older than the Biblical account.

Some of the fruits of Jefferson's paleontology became part of the collections at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia. Beginning in 1849 these holdings were transferred over to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, where they are currently housed. This is the Thomas Jefferson Fossil Collection.

American Mastodon *(Mammut americanum)*
======================================

The American mastodon (Mammut americanum) is a late Pliocene/Pleistocene relative of modern elephants whose fossils have been found only in North America. The discovery of the mastodon has played a central role to the emergence of the science of paleontology and the national identity of the young United States.

First discovered in 1705, this mysterious giant would fuel the imagination and curiosity of theologians, philosophers, patriots and scientists from both sides of the Atlantic throughout the 18th century and into the early part of the 19th century. Thomas Jefferson was one of the people captivated by this giant creature. He spent considerable effort and expense in securing its fossils; most of the fossils in the Thomas Jefferson Fossil Collection belong to this species.

![mastodon molar](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220053im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/illust/mammut_blumenbach.jpg)

The earliest European reports of the mastodon followed the 1705 discovery of a fist-sized tooth and bone fragments near the village of Claverack in the Hudson River valley of Colonial New York. Accounts by two Puritan clergymen, Edward Taylor and Cotton Mather, popularized the discovery and attributed the remains to a race of giants destroyed during the Biblical Flood. Mather also wrote to the Royal Society in London on the "Giant of Claverack" and the tooth made its way into the Society's collection of curiosities.

Giants were popular in the folklore of many cultures. Indeed, Edward Taylor invoked Native American legends of human giants in his account of the "Giant of Claverack." They were also prominent in the two pillars of Western Civilization: the Classics of Ancient Greece and Rome, and the teachings of the Church. For instance, many ancient Romans and Hellenistic Greeks believed that gigantic Cyclops were the first inhabitants of Sicily. Accounts of giants can also be found in the works of Virgil, Pliny and Homer. Christian references to giants extended from its early years to well into the 18th century. For example, Saint Augustine described a gigantic "human" molar and wrote of an antediluvian race of long-lived giants in his 413 A.D. masterwork, The City of God. In 1665, the Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher provided a compilation of giant accounts. He criticized some accounts that he believed exaggerated their size, but never called into question their existence.

## Enter the French

During the first half of the 1700s, most of North America was claimed by three European superpowers. Spain occupied Mexico and Florida while the Britain domains included the thirteen Atlantic colonies and the Hudson Bay Region. The French controlled Quebec and the Great Lakes and claimed the vast interior drainages of the Missouri, Mississippi and Ohio Rivers.

In 1739, Baron Charles de Lougueuil commanded French troops and their Native American allies in a campaign against the Chickasaw in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Early in the campaign Lougueuil's party stopped by a marsh near the Ohio River that was probably the site later known as Big Bone Lick. Several fossils were collected at the site, including a tusk, a femur (upper leg bone) and at least three molar teeth. Following the completion of the campaign in 1740, Lougueuil sent these fossils to the Cabinet du Roi (Royal Cabinet of Curiosities) in Paris.

![femurs](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220056im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/illust/mammut_Daubenton-femur-250.jpg)

The Ohio specimens at the Cabinet du Roi laid in relative obscurity until Jean-Etienne Geuttard published an article in 1756 on North American geology. In it he presented an illustration of one of the molars and puzzled over its identity: "From what animal is this?"

The first systematic examination of Lougueuil's fossils was published in 1762 by Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton. Anatomical comparisons of the femur (upper rear leg bone) with that of an elephant and that of the Siberian mammoth led Daubenton to conclude that, although they differed in size, the three femurs were nearly identical in form. The reasonable conclusion, therefore, was that these three animals were all elephants. (At the time, Daubenton and most other naturalists belived that all living elephants belonged to just one species. Many also suspected that the Siberian Mammoth was an elephant.)

Examination of the tusk confirmed Daubenton's identification of the "animal de l'Ohio" (Ohio animal) as an elephant. The teeth, however, were another matter.

The massive molars of elephants (and mammoths) have flat grinding surfaces with numerous low ridges and relatively little enamel. In contrast, the molars of the "animal de l'Ohio" had multiple pairs of pronounced conical knobs covered with dense enamel. It was clear that the Ohio molars could not belong to an elephant. Instead, Daubenton attributed the molars to a giant form of hippopotamus, an animal with somewhat similar teeth. The teeth and bones were reportedly collected together by Native Americans in Lougueuil's party, but Daubenton dismissed these accounts by "ignorant savages". To him, these fossils clearly belonged to two different species.

![molars](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220056im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/illust/molars_mammt_elephant.jpg)

The identification of these Ohio fossils satisfied Daubenton and his superior, George Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon (7). However, the presence of presumably tropical elephants and hippopotami so far north was puzzling. Similarly, the remains of the Siberian mammoth, which was also considered an elephant, were found even further north.

The typical explanation for this anomalous distribution was that their remains were transported north during the massive biblical flood. For Buffon, this explanation was insufficient. Instead, he concluded that if elephants were once found so far north, then these northern lands must have once been tropical. The existence of northern elephants ultimately led Buffon to develop a remarkable "Theory of the Earth", the details of which were published in his Epoques de la Nature in 1778. (See Epochs of Nature.)

*Notes:*

+ Most autorities believe that Longueuil fossil site was Big Bone Lick, but this has been contested in a 1943 paper by the famous American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson. Instead, Simpson believed that Longueuil probably recovered the fossils from further downstream the Ohio River.
+ Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton (1716-1800) was the lead anatomist of the Cabinet du Roi and one of the world's leading authorities on vertebrates during much of the 18th century.
+ Scattered accounts of giant bones from northern Siberia had existed for several centuries. Indeed, the tusks from fossil mammoths provided an important source of raw material for the ivory trade. Scientific interest in the Siberian mammoth intensified in the late 17th century and early 18th century after Western Europeans in the service of the Russian czar Peter the Great published eyewitness accounts and/or collected mammoth fossils. The new accounts and evidence led most scholars, including John Breyne of Danzig and Hans Sloan of London, to conclude that the Siberian mammoth was an elephant. By 1796 the French anatomist Georges Cuvier concluded that the Siberian mammoth is not an elephant, but rather is an extinct relative commonly known as the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius). This widely distributed species has also been collected from Big Bone Lick and elsewhere in North America. (See Woolly Mammoth.)
+ The extinction of animals was inconceivable for most European scientists of the 18th century. It ran counter to firmly held beliefs by both Christian and Deists of the perfect creation. Moreover, the fossils of both the Siberian mammoth and the "Ohio animal" were only a few thousand years old. Unlike many older fossils, which are commonly embedded in hard rock, these fossils were typically found in unconsolidated surficial deposits (e.g., wetlands muck, soil or gravel) or even ice. (See Fossils and Extinction.)
+ George Louis Leclerc, comte de Buffon (1707-1788) is widely regarded as the greatest naturalist or biologist of the 17th century and his 36 volume Histoire naturelle was the most influential natural history publication of the Enlightenment. In addition to this epic work, Buffon is best known for his innovative Des époques de la nature (Epochs of Nature) and his Theory of American Degeneracy. This last theory elicited a spirited rebuttal by Thomas Jefferson.

## Enter the British

([Back to mastodons](#american-mastodon-mammut-americanum))

![british](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220101im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/images/NA-1766.jpg)

By the early 1750s, traders, surveyors and land speculators from the British colonies began extending into the Ohio River valley. Accounts of the remarkable bones and teeth from the Big Bone Lick soon made their way back to influential colonists, including George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. The occasional fossil specimen also found its way back East. The incursion of British colonials into the Ohio Valley alarmed the French and led to the Seven Year War (1756-1763, also known as the French and Indian War). At the conclusion of the war, the French were driven from North America and British colonials returned to the Ohio in even greater numbers.

Native American groups formerly allied with the French became concerned about these renewed incursions. In 1765, British authorities sent George Croghan to the Ohio Valley in an effort to ease these concerns. During his travels he stopped at Big Bone Lick and collected a few specimens, but these were lost after his party was captured by an Illinois war party.

Croghan eventually secured his release and returned to the Ohio Valley in 1766 with a much larger party to trade with Native Americans and to re-supply a British garrison. This time they spent an entire day at Big Bone Lick and collected hundreds of pounds of bones and teeth. Upon his return, Croghan sent his specimens to Lord Shelburne, the British minister for the American colonies, and to Benjamin Franklin, who at the time was an influential Pennsylvania lobbyist living in London. Lord Shelburne received two tusks, several isolated molars and a lower jaw containing two molars. Franklin received four tusks, a vertebra and three molars.

The Royal Society was presented with another interpretation of Croghan's fossils in early 1768. This time by William Hunter, a prestigious lecturer of anatomy and a physician who attended to the Queen. He compared the London fossils with the jaws and molars of a modern elephant as well as the illustrations from Daubenton's 1762 publication. Hunter concluded that the creature, now dubbed the "American incognitum", was distinct from the elephant, but that it may belong to the same species as the Siberian mammoth. The pronounced knobs on the teeth had convinced him that, unlike the elephant, this animal was carnivorous. Significantly, Hunter also concluded that the beast was probably extinct. Indeed, he told his audience that they should be grateful that such a monster no longer presented a threat to men.

Morgan returned from Big Bone Lick with his own fossils. These fossils were later turned over to Morgans brother John.

British naturalists lost direct access to American fossils following the start of the Revolutionary War and most Americans were understandably preoccupied with the conflict. However, interest in the giant animal known either as the "American incognitum" or the "Mammoth" increased during the waning months of the war and into the first decades of the new nation. By the turn of the century, many Americans had embraced the idea that the imposing animal represented by these fossils served as a foil to European perceptions of American inferiority.

Several factors contributed to the change in importance of the "Mammoth". For instance, renewed expansion by American settlers into the Ohio River valley following the decline in British influence enhanced the fame of Big Bone Lick and the fossils therein. But rising interest may best be attributed to the activities of three men. The most famous is Thomas Jefferson, who's role in this story was spurred by a request from the French Delegation in Philadelphia to know more about his country and fueled by the offense he took to an influential theory by the leading naturalist of his day. The second is Charles Willson Peale, a Philadelphia painter dedicated to celebrating the glories of the new nation. The third, ironically, wasn't an American at all. In fact, he was a former enemy.

![jaw fragment](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220104im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/illust/mammut_peale-palate-200.jpg)

Christian Friedrich Michaelis was a German physician who had served with the British during the Revolutionary War. Michaelis was deeply interested in the "American incognitum" and familiar with the works of Daubenton, Collinson and Hunter. Following the British defeat at Yorktown (but before the formal cessation of hostilities in 1783) he befriended George Washington. The American general related a story of incognitum fossils recovered from a farm in the Hudson River Valley and assisted the German physician in finding more. The search in New York yielded nothing so Michaelis tried to visit Big Bone Lick, but he was frustrated in his attempt to reach the promising, but remote site. He then inquired about a collection of fossils owned by John Morgan, a physician living in Philadelphia.

John Morgan received the collection from his brother, who had accompanied George Croghan during the 1766 visit to Big Bone Lick. However, he wasn't particularly interested in the collection and it languished in relative obscurity for many years. In 1782 Michaelis tried to buy the collection but Morgan balked. He did, however, allow Michaelis to hire Charles Willson Peale, a leading Philadelphia painter, to illustrate the specimens. Peale moved the specimens to his studio and while the fossils were there, they were marveled at by several of Peale's associates. Michaelis would return to Europe with his illustrations while Peale and many of countrymen were inspired to learn more about this animal.

## Jefferson's Notes

([Back to mastodons](#american-mastodon-mammut-americanum))

![Jefferson](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220107im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/images/TJ-Peale-1791.jpg)

Thomas Jefferson started writing what would become his Notes on the State of Virginia in 1781 in response to a list of queries by the French delegation in Philadelphia concerning the American states they were assisting. This work soon evolved into a substantial book that would encompass detailed discourses on a number of topics concerning Virginia and the United States. Jefferson published a limited and private edition in 1785 and a larger, public edition in 1787, but many of his ideas found their way into American discourse well before people had a chance to read his book.

Perhaps the most influential pre-publication element of Jefferson's Notes was his spirited rebuttal to Buffon concerning the Frenchman's theory of American Degeneracy. Buffon's theory, elaborated upon in 1761, stated that the animals of the New World, including the United States lacked the size, vigor and variety of their Old World counterparts. This inferiority, which Buffon attributed primarily to a humid and cold climate, extended to Native Americans, to livestock imported from Europe and according to some of Buffon's disciples to transplanted Europeans as well. It's not surprising that Americans took offense.

The centerpiece of Jefferson's rebuttal was a set of lists comparing the size and variety of American and European animals. Significantly, the animal at the top of Jefferson's list was the mastodon, then known variously as the "Mammoth", "American incognitum" and "animal de l'Ohio". Although he acknowledged that this animal might be extinct, Jefferson suspected that it still roamed the vast wilderness of North America. Whether living or not, it was clear to Jefferson and his contemporaries that this giant was "the largest of all terrestrial beings". Consequently, Jefferson regarded the "Mammoth" as perhaps one of the most compelling arguments against Buffon's theory of American Degeneracy:

> "But to whatever animal we ascribe these remains, it is certain such a one has existed in America, and that it has been the largest of all terrestrial beings. It should have sufficed to have rescued the earth it inhabited, and the atmosphere it breathed, from the imputation of impotence in the conception and nourishment of animal life on a large scale: to have stifled, in its birth, the opinion of a writer [Buffon], the most learned too of all others in the science of animal history, that in the new world, that nature is less active, less energetic on one side of the globe than she is on the other."

Jefferson also disputed Buffon's and Daubenton's contention that the fossils recovered from Big Bone Lick belonged to the elephant and a giant hippopotamus. Rather, he agreed with Collinson and Hunter that the fossils represented a single animal similar to, but distinct from the elephant. Like the British naturalists, Jefferson was struck by the exclusive occurrence of this animal and the Siberian mammoth in the northern latitudes, and he also suspected that the Siberian mammoth and the American "Mammoth" were the same species. In contrast, the elephant was found only in the tropics. To Jefferson, this giant of the North discredited Buffon's contention that cold climates led to degeneracy.

Jefferson believed that the "Mammoth" was probably a carnivore. This opinion, introduced by William Hunter in 1766 and shared by many of Jefferson's contemporaries, was based in part on the jagged biting surfaces of the animal's molars. It was also influenced by reports of the shattered bones of presumed prey at Big Bone Lick and by Native American legends popularized by Jefferson in his book. The image of a giant hunter rampaging through the wilderness fueled the imagination of many Americans offended by the Theory of Degeneracy and envious of Europe's cultural legacy. Europeans could point to the ruins of Classical Greece and Rome. America lacked Europe's antiquities, but the citizens of the new nation could boast of their natural wonders and the massive bones and teeth of the "Mammoth".

*Notes:*

+ Jefferson published a private edition of Notes in 1785 to distribute among his friends and associates in America and Europe. He hadn't intended to release a public edition largely because he feared its impact on Virginia politics. However, news of unauthorized French and English editions prompted him to change his mind. Many of his ideas became familiar among influential Americans either through the circulation of his manuscript or the private edition. But a broader audience was also exposed before the release of the 1787 public edition. For instance, excerpts were published in the Columbian Magazine months before its release.

## The Search Heats Up

([Back to mastodons](#american-mastodon-mammut-americanum))

![mammoth femur](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220109im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/illust/columbian-femur.jpg)

Interest in the "Mammoth" (American mastodon) increased dramatically following the Revolutionary War. Accounts of fossil finds from Big Bone Lick and the Hudson River Valley find their way into popular publications, as do excerpts and paraphrases of Jefferson's use of the "Mammoth" in his rebuttal to Buffon's theory of American Degeneracy. Meanwhile, presentations on fossils become regular events at learned societies in Boston, New York and Philadelphia, and Charles Willson Peale opens his American Museum to the public.

Two significant excavations at Big Bone Lick occur during this period. An excursion to the site in 1786 by Samuel Parsons yielded about 400 pounds of bones, including a femur, jaws with teeth and isolated molars. Knowledge of Parsons' expedition was largely limited to his circle of New England associates until his account was published by the Boston-based American Academy of Arts and Science in 1793.

In 1795, William Henry Harrison conducted what was probably the most ambitious excavation at Big Bone Lick to date. Harrison, then the governor of the Northwest Territories, retrieved enough fossils to fill 13 large wooden containers. Unfortunately, these were lost when his flatboat capsized in the Ohio River enroute to Pittsburgh.

The interest in fossils was especially keen at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, the oldest and most prestigious learned society in the country. Reports on fossils from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Virginia and the Carolinas were regularly features at the society's meetings, but two particularly significant presentations occurred in the final years of the 18 th century. In March of 1797, Thomas Jefferson presented his fossils of "Megalonyx" or "giant claw" to the Society. This exciting new discovery, believed to be the partial remains of a giant tiger, prompted many members to consider the possibility of a second monster roaming the American wilderness.

Later, member George Turner presented the Society with an eyewitness account of Big Bone Lick and a detailed discourse of the current state of knowledge concerning the "Mammoth". Turner agreed with Jefferson that the "Mammoth" was not the elephant, but rather an unknown animal. He also agreed in that this animal was a carnivore. Indeed, Turner inferred that this animal had tremendous leaping ability and large claws. On the other hand, he differed from Jefferson on two significant points. First, he declared that comparisons of their teeth demonstrated that the American "Mammoth" was not the same species as the Siberian Mammoth. Second, he was convinced that both the Siberian Mammoth the American "Mammoth" were extinct.

Perhaps the most significant element of George Turner's talk was his call for the American Philosophical Society to find a complete skeleton. In response, Thomas Jefferson, the new president of the Philosophical Society, appointed a committee to generate a printed appeal for archaeological and natural antiquities. The letter stressed the need to find a complete skeleton of the "Mammoth" and designated Big Bone Lick as the most promising site. The appeal was published in 1799.

## Peale's "Mammoth"

Although Big Bone Lick was widely regarded as the most promising site to exhume the complete skeleton of the "Mammoth" (American Mastodon) , this achievement would finally occur in the Hudson River valley. Scattered "Mammoth" fossils had been recovered in the area for nearly a century, most notably the 1705 discovery of the "Giant of Claverack" and the excavations by Robert Annan in 1780.

In 1799, workmen digging in a marl pit on John Masten's farm uncovered a massive femur. A frenzy of digging ensued as neighbors descended upon the site and soon a considerable assemblage of bones laid on the floor of Masten's granary. Interest in these unusual bones soon diminished until the next year when local clergy and physicians alerted of their importance by the American Philosophical Society's appeal sent news of the discovery to associates New York City and ultimately to Philadelphia and Thomas Jefferson.

Despite being embroiled in the most serious electoral challenge of the new republic, Jefferson sent an emissary to procure the bones. However, Masten and the local townspeople balked.

Charles Willson Peale traveled to Masten's farm in 1801, obstensibly to draw the fossils, but he soon bought the bones on the granary floor and the secured the right to excavate for others. Peale returned to Philadelphia to obtain the support of the American Philosophical Society and Jefferson. Later that year he was back at Masten's farm leading an ambitious excavation, which, unfortunately, yielded little new material. Following leads at other local sites, Peale's team ultimately exhumed a nearly complete second skeleton at Millspaw's Bog.

Triumphant, Peale and his skeletons returned to Philadelphia. He spent the next three months reconstructing the animal under the supervision of Caspar Wistar, the leading anatomist of the country; those bones that were not recovered were substituted with either wood or paper mache. The completed first skeleton generated a sensation in its debut at the American Philosophical Society in late December of 1801 and was a rousing success when it was displayed to the public soon thereafter. "Mammoth" fever swept the country.

![skeleton](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220111im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/illust/mammut_skeleton.jpg)

Charles Willson Peale's son, Rembrandt, accompanied the second skeleton on a tour of Europe. The stopover exhibition in New York City proved extremely successful, but the reception in London was mixed. While the exhibit was popular with many in London's "polite society", the high admission fee excluded many potential visitors. After an initial success, attendance declined. Moreover, some British naturalists insisted that the skeleton was actually that of an elephant. In an effort to differentiate the "Mammoth" from the elephant and to renew interest in the exhibit, Rembrandt Peale substantially revised the exhibit's pamphlet. The stories of the exhumation and reconstruction were expanded and a detailed description of the bones and teeth was added; these descriptions would later prove vital to scientists working elsewhere in Europe. The pamphlet also revealed Peale's changing interpretation of the animal.

As the exhibit languished in London, Rembrandt Peal hoped that his fortunes would improve when he sailed for Paris. He knew that the renowned French anatomist Georges Cuvier was very interested in the "Mammoth" and he had hoped to sell the skeleton to the National Museum of Natural History. Unfortunately, the British declaration of war against Napoleon precluded the trip to France and prompted the return of Rembrandt Peale and his "Mammoth" to Philadelphia.

*Notes:*

+ In 1780, workmen on Reverend Robert Annan's farm in the Hudson River Valley of New York dug up some "Mammoth" molars. Additional excavations prompted by Annon yielded additional molars and some bone fragments. The fossils generated a stir among the local gentry. They also reportedly enticed George Washington to travel to Annan's farm from his winter headquarters some ten miles away. See Part 2 - First Reports for more information on the "Giant of Claverack".
+ Marl is a mixture of clay and carbonates often used as fertilizer.
+ In 1799, the American Philosophical Society issued an appeal for natural and archeological antiquities. In particular, the society's appeal stressed the need to find a complete skeleton of the "Mammoth."
+ The hotly contested election of 1800 presented the most serious challenge to the national government since the ratification of the Constitution. It was a three-way contest between two Federalists, John Adams and Charles Pickney and two challengers from the Democratic-Republican Party, Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. Results from the electoral college resulted in a tie between Burr and Jefferson (73 votes) with the Federalists split between Adams (65) and Pickney (65). The contest then went to the House of Representatives to resolve the tie between Burr and Jefferson. The Fedrealist, which dominated House, were strongly opposed both candidates and there were concerns that they would opt for a tie to force some kind of constitutional alternative. However, after 36 ballots the House finally elected Jefferson, who the Federalists regarded as the lesser of two evils.
+ Although the skeletons were remarkably complete, even by today's standards, Peale's fossils were missing one key element, the top of the skull. The bones of upper skull in mastodons are relatively thin and laced with sinuses. This reduces the skull's weight, but it also makes it substantially less durable than the reinforced bones of the lower skull or limbs.
+ Like many of his contemporaries, Rembrandt Peale believed that the "Mammoth" was a carnivore. He noted that its tusks were too long and too curved to be used in the same way they are used in elephants. Consequently, he inverted the tusks so that they were more like those of a walrus. He also discredited the image of an active predator akin to the lion or tiger. Instead, he envisioned an aquatic carnivore that fed on turtles, fish and shellfish.
+ Georges Curvier (1796-1832) is widely regarded as the founder of the science of paleontology. His first paper, presented in 1796, stated that the "animal du l'Ohio" or "Mammoth" was distinct from both modern elephants and the Siberian mammoth. Cuvier also stated that it was extinct. (See Meanwhile, in Europe for more information.) A 1801 publication by Cuvier (An Appeal for International Cooperation) was extensively quoted in Rembrandt Peale's Disquisition.
+ After returning to Philadelphia, Rembrandt Peale took the second skeleton on a Southern tour, which included Charleston (South Carolina) and Baltimore (Maryland). In 1813, Rembrandt Peale would open a permanent museum in Baltimore featuring this second skeleton.

## Fossils in the White House

([Back to mastodons](#american-mastodon-mammut-americanum))

During the first years of the 19th century, most interest in the "Mammoth" (mastodon) was understandably directed toward Charles Wilson Peale’s specimen in Philadelphia. But in July of 1803, Peale informed President Jefferson of a sizable new discovery of bones at Big Bone Lick by a Cincinnati physician, William Goforth. Later that year, Jefferson asked Meriwether Lewis to visit Goforth on his way to joining William Clark and the Corps of Discovery. Lewis reviewed the collection and sent a report to Jefferson. He also sent the president a tusk and a molar belonging to the "mammoth" and a molar belonging to an "elephant" (actually a woolly mammoth), but these were lost when the boat carrying them sank in the Lower Mississippi River.

Goforth hoped to sell his collection, which now amounted to ten crates weighing several tons, to either Charles Willson Peale, the American Philosophical Society or someone in Europe. However, the agent he hired for the sale, Thomas Ashe, made off with the bones and took them to England where he put them on display. Ashe later sold the collection and absconded with the money. An inventory of the collection indicated that it contained a well-preserved skull, a crucial element missing from Peale’s "Mammoth" in Philadelphia.

In 1807, Thomas Jefferson renewed his effort to obtain "Mammoth" fossils from Big Bone Lick by enlisting William Clark, who had recently returned from the Far West. Unfortunately, collectors had been removing fossils from Big Bone Lick for decades. In a September 20 correspondence to Jefferson, Clark pessimistically commented: "This Lick has been pillaged so frequently that but few valuable bones are to be found entire."

The Clark-Jefferson Expedition, which was personally financed by Jefferson, would employ ten laborers and spend several weeks at the site. A scattering of bones, teeth and fragments could be found at the surface and at depth, but no intact or partially intact skeletons were discovered. Moreover, many of the more fragile bones the team exhumed would crumble upon exposure to the air. Considerable effort in securing two parts of the skeleton missing in Peale’s "Mammoth": the top of the head and front feet. Clark had some success with the feet, but not the head. For example, Clark lamented in his second (November 10) correspondence to Jefferson:

> "I regret very much the loss of this head, it is impossible to save those that are taken out of the water, and it is in the water or Mires the Most entire bones are found."

Nonetheless, Clark’s party persisted and by the end of their stay had collected several hundred specimens. The majority, including teeth, upper and lower jaws, tusk fragments, a rib fragment, limb bones and foot bones, were from the "Mammoth" (American mastodon). Most of the remaining fossils belonged to what Clark identified as the "Eliphant" (woolly mammoth). Several other species, identified as a "sheep or goat species", a horse, a "Moose Deer" or "Elk", and a "Buffalow Cow," were also collected.

Fearing a mishap like those that afflicted so many of the earlier attempts to recover fossils from Big Bone Lick, William Clark divided the fossils into two parts. One part was sent immediately to Jefferson in Washington. The second was stored at his brother’s (George Rogers Clark) residence in Clarksville, Indiana. As it turns out, the first part would make it to Jefferson without incident. Unfortunately, the part stored in Clarksville would later be lost when the ship carrying it to Washington via New Orleans was impounded in Havana.

Jefferson was delighted with Clark’s effort. In response to Clark’s November 10, 1807 report, which included a detailed inventory of the first shipment, the president wrote Clark on December 19:

> "The collection you have made is so considerable that it has suggested an idea I had not before. I see that after taking out for the Philosophical society [American Philosophical Society] everything they shall desire there will remain such a collection of duplicates, as will be a grateful offering from me to the National institute of France for whom I am bound to do something."

The first and only successful shipment from Clark arrived at the White House in March of 1808. Jefferson had these fossils spread out in a large otherwise unused room that later would become known as the East Room. By late June, Jefferson was joined by Caspar Wistar, a prominent Philadelphian physician and the foremost anatomist of the United States. Together they divided the fossils into three groups. The first went to the American Philosophical Society. This group would later be transferred to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia and become known as the Thomas Jefferson Fossil Collection. The second group would be sent to the Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle (the Natural History Museum in Paris). It would arrive in September of 1808. The third and smallest part would become part of Jefferson's personal collection at Monticello.

*Notes:*

+ The Corps of Discovery was the team of explorers that participated in the Lewis & Clark Expedition (1804-1806). The expedition was authorized by Jefferson to explore the Louisiana Purchase and discover a navigable route via the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean. As part of the exploration, Meriwether Lewis was instructed to report (and collect) on the unexplored region's natural history, including animals "which may be deemed rare or extinct". Although the "mammoth" wasn't explicitly named in Lewis' instructions, the consensus among historians is that Jefferson hoped that the expedition would find the celebrated animal still roaming the West. On the other hand, Jefferson explicitly stated this hope of discovering living "mammoths" in an 1803 letter to the French naturalist Bernard Lacépède.
+ Clark's included some of his beliefs about the "mammoth" in his letters to Jefferson. Like many of his contemporaries, he believed that it was an awesome predator. He also believed it was now extinct.
+ William Clark believed that the "eliphant" at Big Bone Lick was the same animal as the Siberian mammoth. This conclusion was corroborated one year later by the French scientists Bernard Lacépède and George Cuvier. This animal in now known as the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius). See About the Woolly Mammoth for more information. (go back]
+ Four other extinct species were collected during the Clark-Jefferson expedition. Considering his lack of formal anatomical training, Clark did remarkably well in identifying these unknown species; it would take trained anatomists and paleontologists several decades later to reasonably identify these animals. The "sheep or goat species" was probably Harlan's Musk Ox (Bootherium bombifrons). The horse was probably an extinct native species, the ancient horse (Equus complicatus). The "Buffalow Cow" was the ancient bison (Bison antiquus). The "Moose Deer" or "Elk" was the Stag Moose (Cervalces scotti).
+ While he was an American minister to France during the 1780s, Jefferson became aquainted with some of the younger naturalists at the Cabinet du Roi (Royal Cabinet of Curiosities), including Bernard Lacépède, Andrè Thouin and Faujas de Saint-Fond. They provided access to the impressive natural history collection and helped Jefferson in his efforts to meet with the leading naturalist of the period, Buffon. (go back]
+ Caspar Wistar (1761-1818) was the leading American authority of fossil vertebrates during the late 18th century and early 19th century. He correctly identified Jefferson's "Giant Claw" (Megalonyx) as a giant sloth. He also published his analysis on two animals from Big Bone Lick that would later be known as the Stag-Moose and Harlan's Musk Ox

While Americans had direct access to new mastodon fossils, several European naturalists were puzzling over the fossil remains of the "animal de l'Ohio" or "Mammoth". The paucity of specimens and their unfamiliarity led to considerable differences in interpretation. The identity of this unknown animal was far from resolved.

Christian Freiderich Michaelis, who tried repeatedly to obtain fossils while he was in America, returned to Göttingen (Germany) with some fossil illustrations by Charles Willison Peale. In a 1789 publication, Michaelis rejected Daubenton's contention that the Ohio fossils represented an elephant and a gigantic hippopotamus. Instead, he agreed with Hunter and Collison in that these fossils represented a single, unknown animal that was not extinct. Unlike Hunter, Michaelis concluded that its teeth were not those of a carnivore.

Michaelis also added a new, confounding element to the debate on the unknown animal. Using Peale's drawing of an upper jaw fragment, he concluded that the animal lacked the tusks and trunk of the elephant. This unusual interpretation was apparently the result of mistaking front and back on the illustration. Unlike most mammals, the space between the two rows of molars in the mastodon is narrower in the back than in the front. The end that he thought was the front simply left too little room for tusks and no room for a trunk. Unfortunately, Michaelis' interpretation was supported by Petrus Camper, a noted Dutch anatomist and an authority on fossil elephants.

Confusion and debate about this perplexing animal persisted until the issue was effectively resolved by the French anatomist Georges Cuvier. He tackled the subject in his first scholarly paper, Memoire sur les especes d'elephans tant vivantes que fossils, (Memoir on the Species of Elephants, Both Living and Fossil). In his 1796 paper, Cuvier convincingly demonstrates that the "animal de l'Ohio" was different from the Siberian mammoth and that both of these extinct species were distinct from modern elephants. Moreover, he demonstrates that there are two species of living elephants (Indian and African) rather than the commonly accepted single species.

Cuvier returned to the subject of the "animal de l'Ohio" in 1806 with his Sur le grande mastodonte, (About the Great Mastodon). Incorporating information from a variety of sources, including Rembrandt Peale's recent Disquisition on the Mammoth (1803) as well as older publications by Louis Daubenton, Peter Collinson, William Hunter and Petrus Camper, the French anatomist presents a detailed description of the animal and names it Mastodon giganteum . Cuvier named the animal after its distinctive teeth with their pronounced conical knobs (mastos = breast, odon = tooth). The "Mammoth", "American incognitum" or "animal de l'Ohio" is now known as the American mastodon. Although Curvier was the first to adequately describe this animal, two other naturalists had already given it scientific names. In accordance with the rules of Biological Nomenclature, these earlier names take priority and the mastodon is now recognized as Mammut americanum.

Cuvier's 1806 paper on the mastodon was published before fossils from the Clark-Jefferson expedition to Big Bone Lick reached Paris in. Jefferson's fossils were also not included in the 1812 publication Reserches sur les ossemens fossils de quadrupèdes which was primarily a compilation of earlier publications. However, the Jefferson fossils were incorporated in subsequent editions of Reserches sur les osemens fossils and many of the specimens were illustrated.

*Notes:*

+ All fossil images after Cuvier (1825). (go back]
+ Michaelis enlisted Charles Willson Peale to illustrate several fossils of the Ohio animal belonging to John Morgan. The fossils, which were collected from Big Bone Lick in 1766, generated considerable excitement in Peale's studio and ultimately inspired him to launch his natural history museum (see Peale's Museum) and his efforts to secure the complete skeleton of the "Mammoth."   (See Part 4 - Enter the Americans and Part 7 - Peale's Mammoth for more information.)
+ Petrus Camper (1722-1789) was one of Europe's leading anatomists during the 18 th century. He is most famous for his work on craniology (comparative anatomy of the human skull), which was typically applied as a demonstration of European racial superiority. One of Camper's more significant zoological contributions was his publication on the dissection of the Indian elephant. (go back]
+ Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) was one of the leading scientists of the early 19th century. His work on fossil animals effectively founded the science of paleontology. See Cuvier's Revolutions of the Globe for more information.
+ Modern elephants were regarded by most European naturalists as a single species. Some anatomist, most notably Johann Friedirch Blumenbach, suspected that the African and Indian "races" were in fact two different species. Significantly, Cuvier's analysis of the Indian and African species was made possible France's recent military defeat of the Dutch. One of the terms of the peace between the two countries was the transfer of natural history collections to the museum in Paris. The acquisition of these new specimens allowed Cuvier to comprehensively compare the bones and teeth of both types of elephants.
+ Petrus Camper's assertion that the Ohio animal could not have possessed tusks was a significant stumbling block in Cuvier's work on the mastodon. He was reluctant to challenge the late anatomist's findings so he suggested to Camper's son, Adriaan Camper, that the fossil should be reevaluated. The younger Camper, himself a notable anatomist, did so and concluded that his father was in fact in error.
+ The British naturalist Robert Kerr named the American incognitum Elephas americanus in 1792. In 1799, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach named the Ohio animal Mammut ohioticum; Blumenbach also named the Siberian mammoth as Elephas primigenius. Cuvier's name, Mastodon giganteus, was widely used by paleontologists well into the 20th century.
+ The Clark-Jefferson Expedition recovered numerous mastodon fossils from Big Bone Lick in 1807. Upon their arrival in Washington, DC, the fossils were partitioned into three groups. The first was added to the collection at the American Philosophical Society. The second was added to Jefferson's personal collection. The third was donated to the Natural History Museum in Paris. The shipment to Paris arrived in September, 1808.

## Epilogue

([Back to mastodons](#american-mastodon-mammut-americanum))

![warren mastadon](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220123im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/illust/mammut_warren.jpg)

The fossils of the "animal de l'Ohio" collected by Lougueuil in 1739 remained in the Cabinet du Roi until the French Revolution. During the French Revolution, the collections from this royal institution were incorporated into the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle (National Museum of Natural History).

John Morgan's mastodon fossils were eventually sold to Petrus Camper in 1787. They were shipped from Philadelphia to the famous Dutch anatomist the next year, but arrived shortly after his death. They are now housed in the paleontology collection of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands.

Charles Willson Peale's mastodon remained the centerpiece of his museum in Philadelphia until the museum hit hard times during the 1840s. The mastodon skeleton was sent to Europe by speculators in 1848 and was eventually bought by the Hessische Landesmuseum in Darmstadt, Germany.

The mastodon taken by Rembrandt Peale to England returned to Philadelphia in 1804. After touring Southern cities, it was put on public display at Rembrandt Peale's Baltimore Museum when it opened in 1813. These bones were sold off when the museum closed some time later. The status for most of these fossils in unknown, but a few are currently housed at the Maryland Historical Society; two specimens are on exhibit alongside Charles Willson Peale's painting, "Exhuming the Mastodon."

The mastodon fossils from the 1807 Clark-Jefferson expedition to Big Bone Lick were portioned into three collections. One collection was donated to the American Philosophical Society and these were eventually transferred to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. A second collection was donated to the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle (National Museum of Natural History) in Paris; some of these specimens are currently on public display. The third became Thomas Jefferson's personal collection. These were transferred to the University of Virginia following his death in 1826. Unfortunately, the status of many of these specimens is unresolved.

There have been numerous finds of American mastodon fossils since the Clark-Jefferson expedition to Big Bone Lick. Three significant discoveries were made in the first half of the 19th century. In 1830, Benjamin Finnell excavated an impressive collection of mastodon bones from Big Bone Lick. In 1840, Albert Koch collected the remains of several mastodons in Missouri; Koch's specimens are now housed at the Natural History Museum in London. But the most significant mastodon find during this time took place near where Charles Willson Peale collected his "Mammoths." In 1845, a complete mastodon skeleton was found near Newburgh in the Hudson River Valley of New York State. This animal, now known as the Warren Mastodon, is currently on display at the American Museum of Natural History.

Fossils of the American mastodon have been found throughout the United States as well as parts of southern Canada and northern Mexico. A sampling of mastodon sites is presented in the links below.

## More about Mastadons *(Mammut americanum)*

([Back to mastodons](#american-mastodon-mammut-americanum))

![ventral view](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220126im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/illust/mammut_godman_ventral.jpg)

The American mastodon (Mammut americanum) is one of the most celebrated and best known fossil mammals of the Pleistocene Epoch. Its fossils have been collected in the thousands and several complete or nearly complete skeletons have been recovered. Some remarkable specimens have even preserved hair and internal organs.

American mastodons are sometimes confused with their distant relatives, mammoths and elephants. All of them have or had well-developed trunks and tusks, but the mastodons were shorter in height, longer in length and more heavily built. The head was larger, but lacked the distinctive "hump" at the crest that is found in the Indian elephant and mammoths. In addition, the mastodon's head was carried horizontally, whereas those of the elephants and mammoths are or were angled down. Preserved hair from one eastern locality indicates that it had a coat of fine wool overlain with long, coarse guard hairs.

The tusks were generally larger and longer than those of modern elephants, but conspicuously less curved than those of mammoths. They extended horizontally from the skull and curved outwards and then inwards. Young males often had a second, short pair of tusks extending from the lower jaw, but these were lost by maturity.

![lower jaw](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220126im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/illust/mammut_cuvier-jaw-2.jpg)

The most distinct and diagnostic feature of mastodons is their grinding teeth (molars and premolars). Because of their distinctive anatomy, impressive size and durability, molars are typically the most commonly collected of mastodon fossils. These teeth, which are more primitive than those of elephants and mammoths, have pairs of large cusps (knobs) covered by dense enamel. A mastodon had a total six teeth on each side of the jaw during its lifetime (a total of 24 teeth for both sides of the upper and lower jaws). Worn teeth in the front of the jaw were replaced by teeth growing in from the back. Young animals had three teeth on each jaw, but most mature individuals usually only had two and old individuals often had only one.

The American mastodon was an adaptable, wide-ranging, and long-lived species; it exhibited remarkably little variation over time or space. It was restricted to North America, but its remains have been found from Alaska and northern Canada to Honduras and from coast to coast; mastodon fossils have even been collected in fishermen's nets as much as 180 miles (300 km) off the eastern coast of the United States. The earliest records date from 3.7 million years ago (Pliocene). It's generally accepted that this species went extinct between 12,000 and 9,000 years ago.

Fossils are most frequent in the eastern United States and the Great Lakes Region, which were covered by spruce forests and open spruce woodlands during the Pleistocene. Elsewhere, mastodons probably favored forested valleys, lowlands and swamps. Its teeth were well suited for browsing on trees and shrubs, and its tusks may have been used for removing branches. Analysis of undigested plant remains revealed that they fed on a variety of plant types, but conifer needles were typically the most frequent food item.

Most fossils represent single individuals, which has led many researchers to infer that, unlike elephants and mammoths, adult mastodons were solitary. However, the existence of a few mass-mortality sites suggests that it was a social animal. In addition, age studies indicate that mastodons took about 10 years to reach maturity. This interval, which is longer than those of modern elephants, would require extended parental care that is often provided by cohesive herds.

The American mastodon is a member of the family Mammutidae. The earliest known member of the family has been collected from 35 million year old deposits in North Africa. Members spread into Eurasia about 20 million years ago and entered Beringia (eastern Siberia, Alaska and Yukon) about 15 million years ago. Several members of this family have been recorded in North America, but the American mastodon is the only species present in the late Pliocene and Pleistocene. A close relative, Mammut borsoni, inhabited Europe about 3 million years ago (late Pliocene).

Mastodons belong to the Order Proboscidea. A group of mammals characterized by the possession of trunks, tusks (on the upper and/or lower jaws) and heavy bodies. They originated in Africa and extended into Eurasia and the Americas. In addition to the American mastodon, several other proboscideans inhabited North America in the late Pleistocene. Two species of gomphotheres, Cuvieronius tropicus and Haplomastodon waringi, were characteristic of the South American fauna, but extended into the southern part of the North America. Several species of mammoths were also present in the North American Pleistocene. One of these, the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) was also found at Big Bone Lick.

The proboscideans were a diverse and successful group of large mammals. Currently, however, they are represented by only three species, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana), the forest African elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) and the Indian elephant (Elephas maximus).

*Notes:*

+ The presence of small tusks (or their sockets) in the lower jaws of some American mastodons fossils led to one of the more intense debates in American paleontology during the first half of the 19th century. Some naturalists, most notably John Godman and Isaac Hays, argued that the four-tusked individuals belonged to a new genus, Tetracaulodon. On the other hand, Richard Harlan argued that these fossils only represented variants of the American mastodon. The issue was finally resolved when the British paleontologist Richard Owen sided with Harlan. (See the Philadelphia School of Paleontology for more information of Richard Harlan and other early American paleontologists.
+ The trapping of water by the vast continental glaciers dramatically lowered sea levels during the Pleistocene Ice Age. Consequently, large areas of the continental shelf were exposed. Fossils from a variety of terrestrial animals, including mammoths, mastodons and musk oxen have been accidentally collected by commercial fishermen trawling along the shelf floor.
+ Fossil teeth belonging to Mammut borsoni are similar to those of the American mastodon (Mammut americanum). Their presence in European Russia and Italy erroneously led some prominent European authorities, including Buffon and Georges Cuvier, to conclude that the American mastodon was present in both North American and Eurasia.
+ Some authorities consider Haplomastodon waringi to belong to the genus Stegomastodon (S. waringi).

Great Claw *(Megalonyx jeffersonii)*

Next to the American Mastodon, Jefferson's Ground Sloth is the most important fossil animal represented in the Thomas Jefferson Fossil Collection. This unusual animal was the subject of the first and second scientific articles on fossils ever published in the United States.

## Part 1: The Great Cat

([Back to ground sloths](#great-claw-megalonyx-jeffersonii))  

![digit](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220214im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/illust/megalonyx_claw_510.jpg)

In March of 1797, Jefferson arrived in Philadelphia to attend the inauguration of John Adams as president and himself as vice president. However, his heart and mind may very well been more invested in a talk he would soon give at the American Philosophical Society. He had just been elected president of the society and almost certainly preferred the company of its members to the cabinet of his political rival, Mr. Adams.

![jeff](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220214im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/images/TJ-LOC-1.jpg)

The subject of Jefferson' s talk before the society was a collection of remarkable bones he received from a cave in what is now West Virginia. The bones were discovered while workmen were mining saltpeter (sodium nitrate) from the cave floor. Many of the bones had been taken by locals as souvenirs, but a few of them were salvaged by John Stewart and sent to his friend at Monticello.

At the talk on March 10, Jefferson described the bones, which consisted of a fragment of the upper arm, the two bones of the lower arm and parts of the hand. Menacing claws at the end of each finger, prompting Jefferson to name the animal "Megalonyx" or "Great-Claw". He concluded that these fossils belonged to a large cat such as a lion or tiger. But they were too large to belong to any known cat. Using the anatomical account of the African lion by the French anatomist Daubenton for comparison, Jefferson estimated that the Megalonyx weighed more than three times the weight of the lion. He concluded:

>"Let us say then, what we may safely say, that he was more than three times as large as the lion: that he stood as pre-eminently at the head of the column of clawed animals as the mammoth stood at that of the elephant, rhinoceros and hippopotamus: and than he may have been as formidable an antagonist to the mammoth as the lion to the elephant."

![radius](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220214im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/illust/megalonux_godman_radius_uln.jpg)

Although the Comte de Buffon had been dead for almost a decade, Jefferson was apparently still bothered by his theory of American Degeneracy. The possibility of a giant cat that dwarfed the Old World lion combined with a "Mammoth" (American mastodon) that dwarfed the Old World elephant may have proved irresistible in his longstanding effort to discredit the theory.

Later in his presentation Jefferson argued that the Megalonyx, as well as the "Mammoth" were probably still alive. A couple of his arguments were anecdotal: he related a few accounts of woodsmen being terrorized by a large cat-like animal and a report on a Native American rock drawing that resembles a cat. Three other arguments, however, were more substantial. The first is the philosophical objection that extinction belies the perfection of the Creation. The second is that these giant predators would have to be very rare and thus unlikely to have been familiar. Otherwise. they would "have ultimately extinguished after eating out their pasture." The third argument states that the vastness of wilderness of North America cast doubts on any claim that the animal was extinct:

>"In the present interior of our continent there is surely space and range enough for elephants and lions, if in that climate they could subsist; and for the mammoth and megalonyxes who may subsist there. Our entire ignorance of the immense country to the West and North-West, and of its contents, does not authorise us so say what is does not contain."

*Notes:*

+ President John Adams was a personal friend of Thomas Jefferson, but ideological differences and party politics soon drove a wedge between the two. Adams was a Federalist, although he was considerably more moderate than most of his cabinet. Jefferson, who helped found the Democratic-Republican party, was Adams' opponent during the hotly contested 1796 election. The spirit at the inauguration was bipartisan and conciliatory, but Jefferson was soon excluded from any real participation in the administration.
+ Comte de Buffon was the most influential naturalist of the 18th century. In 1766, he published his Theory of American Degeneracy, which stated that an adverse climate in the New World inhibited the development of native quadrupeds (an archaic classification that includes most mammals) and resulted in the degeneration of those transplanted from the Old World. Buffon extended this effect to Native Americans and some of his disciples extended it to include transplanted Europeans as well. Naturally, these transplants took offense and challenged the theory. Thomas Jefferson was the most prominent of these critics. See American Degeneracy for more information

## Part 2: The Ground Sloth

([Back to ground sloths](#great-claw-megalonyx-jeffersonii))  

An unexpected thing happened to Jefferson before he was to present the talk on Megalonyx (=Great Claw). He had been browsing a Philadelphia bookstore when he chanced upon an article in the British publication Monthly Magazine. It contained a short abstract and illustration based on a 1796 publication by Georges Cuvier on a giant, clawed fossil from Paraguay. The fossil, which was essentially a complete skeleton, belonged to an unknown animal that was clearly related to the South American tree sloths. Cuvier had named this creature Megatherium.

Confronted with the possibility that his "lion" may in fact be a relative of the sloth, Jefferson hastily appended a postscript to his talk. He acknowledged that Megalonyx could, in fact, be Megatherium . On the other hand, Jefferson was skeptical that the two were identical. He remarked that the magazine article's illustration "is not so done as to be relied on, and the account is only an abstract". Moreover, he commented, "having nothing of our animal but the leg and foot bones, we have few points for a comparison between them." Jefferson acknowledged that the limb bones resembled each other but he still reserved judgment. After all, Cuvier's identification of Megatherium as a relative of the sloth was based primarily on its teeth. Jefferson concluded:

>"But to solve satisfactorily the question of identity, the discovery of fore-teeth, or of a jaw bone shewing it had, or had not, such teeth, must be waited for, and hoped with patience. I may be better in the mean time, to keep up the difference of name."

![wistar](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220219im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/images/Wistar-si.jpg)

Jefferson's 1797 talk on the Great-Claw was published in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society in 1799 (Volume 4). Later in that same volume, Caspar Wistar wrote about the Megalonyx bones Jefferson deposited at the society. Wistar, a physician by training and an excellent anatomist, provided detailed descriptions and illustrations of the fossils. He also concluded that the bones did not belong to a cat. Instead, he noted that they were similar in form to those of "bradypus" [Bradypus], the three-toed sloth, but they were many times larger. Wistar considered the illustration and short abstract of the 1796 Monthly Magazine article to be insufficient for a definitive conclusion as to whether Megatherium and Megalonyx were identical. On the other hand, if one accepted the magazine's illustration as reliable, then, Wistar concluded, Megalonyx and Megatherium must be two different species.

Jefferson abandoned his interpretation of Megalonyx as a giant cat sometime after he presented his talk at the American Philosophical Society. Instead, he concluded that it was probably identical to Cuvier's Megatherium. Nevertheless, he did not abandon his belief that the animal was still alive. In a 1803 letter to the French naturalist Bernard Lacépède, Jefferson wrote:

It is not improbable that this voyage of discovery [the Lewis and Clark expedition] will procure further information of the Mammoth [mastodon], & of the Megatherium [Megalonyx].

In a 1804 memoir on ground sloths Georges Cuvier concluded that Jefferon's animal and Megatherium were not identical and that both animals were now extinct. The French naturalist retained Jefferson's name for the animal, Megalonyx. In 1822, another French anatomist, Anselme Demarest, formerly described the fossil and named it Megalonyx jeffersonii in honor of the celebrated American. Joseph Leidy provided a detailed description of this ground sloth from nearly complete material in 1855. (See Leidy on Extinct Ground Sloths).

Jefferson's Megalonyx memoir is arguably the first American publication in paleontology. It was also the first and only paleontology paper written by Jefferson. Thereafter he willingly deferred to Caspar Wistar, whom Jefferson recognized as eminently more qualified. In 1807, Jefferson then president of the United States requested Wistar's expertise in evaluating a roomful of fossils collected by William Clark at Big Bone Lick.

## More about Ground Sloths

([Back to ground sloths](#great-claw-megalonyx-jeffersonii))  

![sloth skull](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220222im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/illust/megalonyx_skull_leidy.jpg)

Jefferson's ground sloth (Megalonyx jeffersonii) was about 8-10 ft (2.5-3 m) in length. It was a heavily built animal, with an estimated maximum weight of 800 lbs (360 kg). The massive skull had a blunt snout, massive jaw, and large peg-like teeth. The hind legs were plantigrade (flat-footed) and together with the stout tail allowed it to rear up into a semi-standing posture to feed on foliage in trees. The forelimbs had three well-developed claws that probably allowed it to strip leaves or manipulate branches.

This species was one of the more widely distributed ground sloths of North America. Its fossils have been recorded from woodland and forest sites in most of the American states east of the Rocky Mountains and along the West Coast. It was the only ground sloth to be widely distributed in Canada and the only species to extend into eastern Beringia (Yukon and Alaska). It appeared in the fossil record during the Illinoian glaciation (more than 150,000 years ago) until the end of the Wisconsinan glaciation (about 10,000 years ago).

Megalonyx jeffersonii was the last member of the family Megalonychidae. The earliest records for this family occur in Oligocene (approximately 35 million years ago) of Patagonia. Several South American genera are known from the middle Miocene, but the record for later members on that continent is poor. On the other hand, immigrants from South America evolved into a diverse array of species in the Caribbean from the late Miocene through the Pleistocene. Two genera, Pliometanastes and Megalonyx, colonized North America via the Caribbean. As a general trend, the megalonychids progressed from small arboreal forms (in South America) to larger, ground-dwelling forms in North America; many of the Caribbean species were relatively small, apparently because of the ecological restrictions of living on small islands.

![more skull](http://web.archive.org/web/20111017220222im_/http://www.ansp.org/museum/jefferson/illust/megatherium_skull_cuvier.jpg)

The remaining ground sloths belong to two other families, the Megatheriidae and the Mylodontidae. Unlike the Megalonychidae, most of the evolutionary history of these two families occurred in South America.

The Megatheriidae consist of two main groups, megatheres and nothrotheres. The megatheres were huge animals reaching as much as 20 ft (6 m) in length and weighing up to 3 tons (2700 kg). The most common North American species was Eremotherium rusconii, which inhabited parts of Texas and the southeastern United States from the late Pliocene through the end of the Pleistocene. Another megathere, Megatherium americanum, was the first ground sloth to be discovered by Europeans (1). In contrast to the megatheres, the nothrotheres were smaller and more gracile (lightly-built). The most common and long-lived North American species, the Shasta ground sloth (Nothrotheriops shastensis), extended from South America into southwestern Canada. It's the best known of the ground sloths. Numerous specimens have been recorded from the La Brea tarpits of California and exceptional specimens from caves in the Colorado Plateau have informed us of its diet, hair, age structure and anatomy. Despite their differences in build, megatheres and nothrotheres share many characteristics, including a relatively long snout and other specializations for browsing shrubs and trees. Unlike Megalonyx, the toes on their hind limbs curved under their feet. Presumably, they were less capable walkers.

The remaining family of ground sloths is the Mylodontidae. These were heavily built animals with short necks and massive chests. They had dermal ossicles (small boney plates underneath the thick hide) and like the Megatheriidae, the toes on their hind limbs curved underneath the feet. The most common North American mylodontidid was the Harlan's ground sloth (named by different authorities as either Paramylodon harlani or Glossotherium harlani). It was about 6 ft (1.8 m) in length and 3500 lbs (1600 Kg) in weight.

The last of the ground sloths became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. Their closest living relatives are the three-toed tree sloths (Bradypodidae) and the two-toed tree sloth (Choloepidae). Each tree sloth family is represented by a single genus, Bradypus and Choloepus, respectively, and both are restricted to South America. Detail of the teeth, hair and number of vertebrae indicate that the three-toed sloths are closely related to the Megatheridae, whereas Megalonyx is most closely allied with the two-toed sloths.

All of the sloths belong to the order Xenarthra (or edentates), Other members of the order include armadillos, anteaters and extinct group of large, armored forms called glyptodonts. As a group, they're characterized by peg-like teeth that lack enamel (the anteaters have secondarily lost their teeth) and by a uniquely complex joint in their vertebrate (backbone). Xenarthrans are also notable for their metabolism. They're less capable of regulating their body temperature than are other placental mammals. This inability means that they are much less active than most other mammals. As it turns out, a sloth is slothful because of physiology, not attitude.

*Notes:*

+ A nearly complete skeleton of Megatherium was discovered in present-day Paraguay in 1789. The bones were sent to Spain where they were reassembled by Juan-Bautista Bru, a conservator at the Royal Museum in Madrid. A copy of Bru's unpublished illustration and a short description of the skeleton was taken to France and examined by Georges Cuvier. In 1796, Cuvier published a paper describing this startlingly large and bizarre animal. He identified it as a relative of the sloth and armadillo, and named it Megatherium. (=giant beast). Bru also published a description of the animal in 1796.

The Save America's Treasures Program provided the original funding for this Online Exhibit on the Thomas Jefferson Fossil Collection. Save America's Treasures grants are administered by the National Park Service in partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute of Museum and Library Services and the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities.

Production of the exhibit was directed by Dr. Edward B. Daeschler of The Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University in Philadelphia. Dr. Daeschler also provided scientific, editorial and imaging assistance. Additional imaging was provided by Eileen Mathias of the Albert M. Greenfield Digital Imaging Center for Collections and the Ewell Sale Stewart Library at The Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia.

This exhibit was originally designed, written and developed by Dennis C. Murphy.

In 2017 it was revised and rewritten by Vincent J. O'Leary, in collaboration with Dr. Edward B. Daeschler and the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.
